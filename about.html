                <p>M.E.R.S.' WonderCare operates during term time and holiday periods at M.E.R.S.' WonderCare Primary School, Valentine Road.
                    M.E.R.S.' WonderCare.</p>
            
                <p>The Playscheme offers high quality child care before school (7.45 -9.00) and after school (3.25 - 6.00) Mon -
                    Friday's. In the school holidays, we operate full day care (7:45am to 5:30pm)

                    catered for in the main school hall before school and at the Community Centre, Heathfield Road after school. We
                    are registered with Ofsted and with Out of School Alliance and meet their recommendations for good practice.</p>
            
            
                <p>The Playcare Scheme is a voluntary organisation, registered charity and a company limited by guarantee. The board
                    of trustees, made up of parents and carers acessing its service along with the schemes full time manager, is
                    responsible for the employment of staff and for the organisation of the scheme. We operate separately from, but
                    enjoy good relationships with the school.</p>
            
                <p>Except for some specific grant funding the scheme is reliant upon the fees and support of parents each year in
                    order to continue.</p>
            
                <p>All parents & carers offered a place on the scheme become members of the company and will be expected to support
                    the scheme in their organisation and to attend wherever possible the Annual General Meetings of the scheme. New
                    parents and carers are encouraged to join the management committee each year in order to replace those that
                    leave.</p>

            <h3>OUR VALUES AND MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>M.E.R.S.' WonderCare believes that the child must be at the centre of the process:
                    the opportunities provided and the organisation which supports, co-ordinates and
                    manages these should always start with the child's needs and offer sufficient flexibility to meet these.
                </li>
                <li>At M.E.R.S.' WonderCare activities should be freely chosen by children, to both empower
                    them and to help them discover their own solutions, to play and develop at their own pace and in their own
                    way.</li>
                <li>Whereas activities may sometimes be enriched by the Playworker's participation, adults should always be
                    sensitive to children's needs and never try to control a child's play so long as it remains within safe and
                    acceptable boundaries.</li>
                <li>We believe every child has a right to a play environment that stimulates and provides opportunities for
                    risk, challenge and the growth of confidence and self - esteem.</li>
                <li>The contemporary environment in which many children grow up does not always lend itself to safe and creative
                    play; all children have the right to a play opportunity
                    that is free from hazard, one which ensures physical and personal safety and is a setting within which the
                    child ultimately feels physically and personally safe.</li>
                <li>M.E.R.S.' WonderCare believes every child is an individual and has the right to be respected to such; each
                    child should feel confident that his / her individuality and
                    diversity is valued by the adults who work and play with them</li>
                <li>A considerate and caring attitude to individual children and their families is essential to competent
                    Playwork and should be displayed at all times.</li>
                <li>Prejudice against people with disabilities or who suffer social and economic disadvantage, racism and sexism
                    have no place in the environment which seeks to enhance
                    development through play: adults involved in play should always promote equality of opportunity and access
                    for all children, and seek to develop anti - discriminatory
                    practice and positive attitudes to those who are disadvantaged.</li>
                <li>Activities should offer the child opportunities to extend her or his exploration and understanding of the
                    wider world and therefore physical, social and culturaI
                    settings beyond their immediate experience.</li>
                <li>Play is essentially a co-operative activity for children. Playworkers should always encourage children to be
                    sensitive to the needs of others in providing activities
                    and play opportunities. They should seek to work together with children, their parents, colleagues and other
                    professionals and where possible, make their own expertise
                    available to the wider community.</li>
                <li>Activities should always be provided within the current legislative framework and good practice principles
                    relevant to children's rights, health, safety and well-being.</li>
                <li>Every child has a right to an environment for play, and such environments must be accessible to children.
                </li>
                <li>M.E.R.S.' WonderCare firmly believes in these values and expects that they underpin the activities of the
                    scheme.</li>
